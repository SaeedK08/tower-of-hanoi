## Tower of Hanoi Game
A Java implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. 
The game allows players to move disks between rods, total of three, according to the standard rules,
aiming to move all disks from the left rod to the right rod in the fewest moves possible.

# Two simple rules
1. Only one disk, the top one on any rod, can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can only be moved to an empty rod or onto a rod whose top disk is larger than the disk being moved.
